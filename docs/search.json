Our goal is to advance knowledge about consumer financial markets in developing countries: how they work, and which policies may make them work more efficiently and more equitably.\nWe use tools from applied microeconomics and causal inference to study how people make financial decisions and what influences their choices. We focus on South African survey and administrative data in a variety of domains, including retirement, insurance, and credit."

We are a research group within the [Department of Economics](https://www.ekon.sun.ac.za) at [Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za). Our goal is to advance knowledge about consumer financial markets in developing countries: how they work, and which policies may make them work more efficiently and more equitably.
